## Description of Animation
The scream character seemed to rigid and somber so I decided to put him on Thunder Island with Jay Ferguson (Greatest song ever) to lift his spirit. The audio animates the sky with different colors (thunder island colors?) and changes shapes to make it look like the sky is moving. Other elements in the portrait also change color

The scream character also is moved by the audio and dances to the music.
